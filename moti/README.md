# Moti
 - The purpose of this project was to calculate the gravity of a celestial object, given its mass and radius, then to plot the projectile motion of a ball being thrown on that celestial object at the specified parameters.
 - For this project, I used basic physics to find the gravity and calulate its motion.
 - Through this project, I learned how to apply physics principles to calulate the gravity and projecile motion through code. Then I learned how to plot the projectile motion of a ball being thrown at the specified parameters. And lastly, I learned how to create a library and animate a plot.
