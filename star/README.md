# Star
 - The purpose of this project was to classify stars using the inputted temperature and gravity.
 - For this project, I used fits files from the Mikulski Archive Website where the read me description defines each variable available and how to use it
    * Mikulski Archive Website: https://archive.stsci.edu/
    * Fits Files:https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/cdbs/grid/k93models/
    * Readme File: https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsps/reference-atlases/cdbs/grid/k93models/AA_README
 - Through this project, I learned how to read in fits files, read user inputted values and use the these values to find and display information from a particular file. Using that file, I learned to plot the given information to create a graph of a star's Wavelength vs Gravity.
