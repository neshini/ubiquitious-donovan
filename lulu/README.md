 - The purpose of this project was to be able to read in, understand and organize large datasets into graphs that display the information from it clearly.
 - For this project, I used Zfourge to get three different datasets, CFS, COSMOS and AGN. Zfourge stands for The FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey aand is a large and deep medium-band imaging survey aimed at establishing an observational benchmark of galaxy properties at redshift z > 1.

 - Through this project, I learned how to use pandas to read in a dataset, create smaller tables from a large dataset and then plot a scatterplot using information from three different datasets.
