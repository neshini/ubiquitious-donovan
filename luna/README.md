# Luna
 - The purpose of this project was to visually show the position of the moon around the earth and it's lunar phases.
 - For this project I used Zingale's phase.py code as an initial referance to start my project.
  * Zingale's phase.py: https://github.com/zingale/astro_animations/blob/master/solar_system_motion/lunar_phases/phases.py
 - Through this project, I learned how to draw and plot various shapes to get my desired output, add text to a plot, use cartopy and create and move subplots.
 - You can find more information in my website neshini.githubio.
